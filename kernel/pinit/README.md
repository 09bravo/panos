# Overview
Pinit as in init system made for panos, it is still in a very unfinished state but it is still usable-ish.
# Starting services
Sadly pinit has no way to start services unless we hard code the functions that we want to start, this will change, but when you may ask ?, when we implent a file system and turn the kernel into a 64 bit one (which is what i am currently working one)
